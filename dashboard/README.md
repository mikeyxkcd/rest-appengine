# Dashboard

This project is for GAE and allows users to easily manage and search the DB.

I don't want to give too much away (it should be self-documenting), but there are several keywords which you can use when creating values. One of the most interesting is `file` which will allow you to upload anything you like to the server and then view it. Best if it is a sound or image.
